// A HumanPlayer chooses its move by prompting a person running the program for a move (reprompting if necessary until the person enters a valid hole number), and returning that choice. We will never test for a situation where the user doesn't enter an integer when prompted for a hole number. (The techniques for dealing with the issue completely correctly are a distraction to this project, and involve either a function like stoi or strtol, or the type istringstream.)

// A BadPlayer is a computer player that chooses an arbitrary valid move and returns that choice. "Arbitrary" can be what you like: leftmost, nearest to pot, fewest beans, random, etc.. The point of this class is to have an easy-to-implement class that at least plays legally.

//-------------Smart Player's Functions-----------------
//Here's your chance to shine. A SmartPlayer chooses a valid move and returns it. For any game played on a board of up to six holes per side, with up to four initial beans per hole, SmartPlayer::chooseMove must return its choice in no more than five seconds on the SEASnet Linux server lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu or lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu: (We'll give you a way of determining the time soon; until then, you can meet this requirement by limiting the depth of your game tree search or the number of game tree positions you explore to a limit you determine experimentally.) SmartPlayer::chooseMove will be worth about 15-20% of the points for this project.
