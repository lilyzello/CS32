For any game played on a board of up to six holes per side, with up to four initial beans per hole, SmartPlayer::chooseMove must return its choice in no more than five seconds on the SEASnet Linux server lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu or lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu: (We'll give you a way of determining the time soon; until then, you can meet this requirement by limiting the depth of your game tree search or the number of game tree positions you explore to a limit you determine experimentally.) SmartPlayer::chooseMove will be worth about 15-20% of the points for this project.
